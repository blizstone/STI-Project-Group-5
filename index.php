      The first common scam. Police impersonation scam. In this scam, someone alleging to be a police officer will contact you saying that someone has committed a crime using your identity and you are under investigation and ask for a desposit to handle the case. No law enforcement agency will call you and ask for a sum.

      Second common scam. The lottery scam. In this scam, someone will call you claiming that you have a won a huge sum of money. However, to send this sum of money to you, they might ask you for your bank login details or to transfer an amount of money to cover 'fees'. Do not hand over your banking information or transfer any money to them.

    <div class="box-3">
      Third most common scam is the kidnap scam. In this scam, someone would claim to have kidnapped your loved ones and would demand a ransom. Do not panic and transfer any money to them. Instead call the police for assistance and seek help to make sure. This scam works all the time as the scammer preys on your emotions and manages to convince you.
